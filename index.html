                    <p>Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. He was the first child born to Hermann and Pauline Einstein. Though
                        he attended school as a young boy, he also received instruction at home on Judaism and violin. By the age of twelve he
                        had taught himself geometry. At the age of sixteen he failed an exam in order to qualify to train as an electrical engineer.
                        He remained in school and developed a new plan for his future. Einstein decided to study math and physics so he could
                        become a teacher. Einstein thought he would be good at this because he could think mathematically and abstractly
                        while lacking imagination and practicality. In 1896 he renounced his German citizenship. He was not a citizen of any
                        country until 1901 when he became a citizen of Switzerland. In 1900 he graduated as a teacher of math and physics.
                        His teachers did not think very highly of him though so he had difficulty being recommended for a job at a university. In
                        1901 he took a job as a temporary high school teacher and married Mileva Maritsch. The couple had two sons prior to
                        divorcing. Einstein later married his cousin Elsa Einstein. From 1902 through 1909, Einstein worked in a patent office in
                        Bern, Switzerland. While working in the patent office he published many papers on theoretical physics. He earned a
                        Ph.D. in 1905.</p>

                        <li>I Never cared about dressing. My wife suggested me to dress more professionally while I was attending my 1st conference. I replied "non one knows me there". Later times I Replied "Everyone knows me there". So no one bothered about my dressing, As I never did</li>
                        <li> When Albert Einstein was working at Princeton university, one day he was going back home he forgot his home address. The driver of the cab did not recognize him. Einstein asked the driver if he knows Einstein's home. The driver said "Who does not know Einstein's address? Everyone in Princeton knows. Do you want to meet him?. Einstein replied "I am Einstein. I forgot my home address, can you take me there? "The driver dropped him to his home and did not even collect his fare from him.</li>
